# LogPass reusable GitHub Workflows

Common, reusable GitHub workflows used by LogPass.

[Reusable workflows reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows).

## Workflows naming convention

All reusable workflows should be named with `*` prefix (e.g. `*misspell`),
so it will be easy to distinguish reusable workflows in GitHub UI `Actions`
tab at first sight.
